    <h1 class="title1">About Us</h1>
    <p id="intro">As good nature lovers, our company was created by three friends who always loved to go cycling together. Our love for these moments was so great that we wanted to somehow be able to bring this experience to other people, and so we created Vicious Cycles.
        <img id="image_default" src="assets/content_images/cyclist_img.jpg" alt="Cyclist in the forest">
        Our mission is to be able to offer our customers quality products, so that this pleasant moment does not become a nightmare, so we always choose to offer the best in the market in terms of cycling.
        <br>
        We always try to be very transparent with our customers in terms of fair and affordable prices so that everyone can enjoy the pleasure of being able to ride.
        Our greatest joy is when a customer gives us feedback about how much they liked our products and how much they are taking advantage of their free time to be able to do something that is not only pleasurable but also beneficial to their health.
